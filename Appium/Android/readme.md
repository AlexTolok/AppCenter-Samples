# Overview (Appium-Android)
This sample includes an APK file and a pre-written Appium test suite prepared for running in AppCenter/Test or testcloud.xamarin.com. Please see this document for information on preparing an existing Appium test suite for running in AppCenter: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/test-cloud/preparing-for-upload/appium

# Build & running locally
- Build the Maven project using your perferred method.
- If you wish to run the tests locally on a device or emulator, make sure to start the local Appium server before running tests, otherwise the tests will fail. 

(Note: The author of this sample used IntelliJ IDEA 2017.3.4 (Ultimate Edition) on Mac OS X 10.13.3, though other tools for building may work.)
